The File System format consists of .dat files, and .idx* files 
(* = numerical value, identifying each index file.)
Index files generally contain files of the same type, or group.
idx0 contains archive files
idx1 contains model files
idx2 contains animation files
idx3 contains audio (midi) files
idx4 contains map files

Data files consist of 520 byte 'sectors', which holds an 8 byte header,
aswel as 512 bytes of file data.

The 8 byte header format is as follows:

Data			Size (bits)	Description
File number		16		The id of the file contained in this sector
File part number	16		Which part of the file the sector contains
Sector number		24		The sector id (of the whole cache) we are reading
Cache number		8		The cache id of the file in this sector


Index files basically map out the .dat data files. They contain 6 bytes describing
each file under their cache tree.

The 6 bytes describing each file are as follows:

Data			Size (bits)	Description
File Size		24		The size in bytes of the file we're reading
Sector at		24		The sector the file starts at
